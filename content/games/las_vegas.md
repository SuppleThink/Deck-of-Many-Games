# Rules for how to play Las Vegas (Custom Edition)

## Overview:

In Las Vegas, players take turn rolling their dice and putting matching number sets on one of the trays that each represent one of six “Casinos”, with the goal of being the player with the most dice on a Casino tray at the end of the round in order to receive a payout of money cards/chips.

## How to Win:

The player with the most money at the end of four rounds is the winner.

## Component List:

- 40 dice (8 dice in 5 different colors)
- 6 Casino Trays
- Deck of Money Cards (Using 40? playing cards with values from 3 to 10)
- Box lid used as a dice Rolling Tray
- Poker Chips (Optional)

# Setup:

1. Set out the box lid in the middle as a dice Rolling Tray.
2. Set out the six numbered Casino trays in a circle around the Rolling Tray in numerical order from 1 to 6.
3. Give each player 8 dice of the same color, (There are 5 sets of colored dice. Get extra sets of 8 dice if you want more players.
4. Shuffle the deck of playing cards, then put two cards face up next to each of the Casino Trays. Put the higher value card closer to the Casino Tray. If you are using chips, you can put the chips on the card equal in value to the number on the card, to make the payout step easier.
5. Decide who goes first, then play!

### A Player’s Turn:

On a player’s turn, that player rolls all of the dice they have in their hand into the Rolling Tray. Then, they pick all of the dice that have a matching value (they must choose at least one die) and then they place that set of dice on the corresponding numbered Casino tray. Next, they pick back up any dice remaining in the Rolling Tray, in order to roll them again on their next turn. Their turn is now over, and now the player sitting next to them clockwise takes their turn.

`Note that once a player has placed all of their dice on the Casino Trays they are done for the round, and no longer have any actions until the payout step happens at the end of the round.`

### End of Round and Payout:

The round ends once all players have placed all of their dice. Now it is time to determine which players will be getting money from each of the Casinos.
Starting with the number 1 Casino Tray, do the following steps.

1. Casino Tray Tiebreaker Rule: Any color of dice with a tied amount of dice as another color (counting the quantity of dice, not the value shown on the dice), all of those dice are removed from the tray.
   _For example, if there are two red dice and two yellow dice on the same Casino Tray, all four of those dice are removed and neither of those players can possibly receive a payout from that Casino._
2. Determine which player has the most dice on the Casino Tray (quantity of dice, not the value shown on the dice). That player receives the higher value Money Card from that Casino (and any chips on that Money Card) as a payout. Note that if the Casino Tray has no dice (because no one placed any dice on that tray, or dice were removed due to the tiebreaker rule in step 1) then all the money cards are discarded (and chips are returned to the bank).
3. Next determine the player with the second highest number of dice on that Casino Tray. That player receives the lower value Money Card (and chips) from that Casino. Note that if there is no second place player, that money card is discarded and no one gets a payout.
4. Proceed to determine the payout for each of the six Casino Trays in order from 1 to 6.

### Set Up Next Round:

1. Return all dice to their respective players.
2. Draw two money for each Casino Tray. Arrange them with the higher value card placed closer to the tray face up, just like in the start of game setup. (Also put more chips if using chips).
3. The player that won the higher payout for Casino Tray 6 becomes the first player for the next round. If no one got a payout from Casino 6, then the same player who started the previous round can start the next one.

## Ending the Game and Determine the Winner:

After the end of the fourth round, do the final payout step, then the player with the most money is the winner. If there is a tie, as a tiebreaker the player with the most money cards is the winner. If there is still a tie those players are all winners together..

# Additional Optional House Rules:

## Skip and Re-roll House Rule - Version A (needs poker chips)

Additional setup: Give each player $2 in chips at the start of the game.

Additional player action: On each player’s turn, after they roll their dice, if they do not like the roll results, they can pay $1 to the bank to choose to not place any dice on one of the Casino Trays this turn, essentially skipping their turn.

Decide limited use of this ability (or not): As a group, you can agree to limit the Skip and Re-Roll action to once or twice per round, or just agree to let people reroll as much as they want.

Because of the extra time it takes for players to use this optional rule, it is recommended to only play 3 rounds instead of 4.

## Skip and Re-roll House Rule - Version B

Additional setup: Give each player 4 copies of one of the unused playing cards labeled A J Q or K, of their choice.

Additional player action: On each player’s turn, after they roll their dice, if they do not like the roll results they can discard one of the A J Q K cards they are holding in order to not place any dice on one of the Casino Trays this turn, essentially skipping their turn.

Additional End of game scoring rule: At the end of the game, each A J Q K card a player is still holding is worth $1. For tiebreaking purposes they do not count as a money card.

Because of the extra time it takes for players to use this optional rule, it is recommended to only play 3 rounds instead of 4.
