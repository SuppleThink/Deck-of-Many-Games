# High Society (Custom Edition)

## Credit

Original game by Reiner Knizia [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220/high-society]{.tui-button}

### Quick Notes on this custom version:

(credit goes to random guy on SA)
Figured out a way to play this with a standard deck: A-10 of a suit is each players money, shuffle face cards and jokers for the auction pile. Kings are 5 points, Queens are 3, Jacks double the K&Q for that suit (Lost Cities style), and Jokers are a reverse bid round for -7 (-10 seemed too high?). Game ends when 4th King is drawn, score same as High Society where person with lowest money in hand is out.
