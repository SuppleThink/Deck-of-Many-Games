# Welcome, User!

This page contains rules/instructions to play a variety of card games and board games using standard game pieces - specifically a deck of standard playing cards, some dice, and chips/coins. Some games require additional things such as a dice tray, or an extra deck of cards, however.

Take a look at each of these games and hopefully you find something interesting to play :)
